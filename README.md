# 100DaysOfCodingChallenge


Commitment

I will code for at least an hour every day at least for the next 100 days.

Start Date

22nd June 2024

Rules

I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
I will update the [log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that I will add a link to each of the day posts in the log. It can be a link to a commit on GitHub.
If I can't code for some emergency reason, I can miss one day, but not two days. (then I will make it up by adding one more day to the end of the 100).
